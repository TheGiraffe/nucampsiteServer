Start the MongoDB server

You started the MongoDB server in the Introduction to MongoDB exercise. If it is still running, skip to the next section.

If you have closed it since then, you will need to start it again: Open a bash terminal to the 5-NodeJS-Express-MongoDB/mongodb folder and run this command:

mongod --dbpath=data

Make sure that you are in the mongodb folder when you run this command. Leave the server running in this bash terminal.
